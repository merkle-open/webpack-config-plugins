exports[`TsConfigWebpackPlugin inside webpack context should warn if --skipLibCheck is not specified 1`] = `
"Warning: skipLibCheck option was NOT specified
By default the fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin will check all types inside the node_modules directory
even for unused dependencies and slow down the type checking a lot.
To skip that checking add the following line to your tsconfig.json compilerOptions configuration:
\\"skipLibCheck\\": true
To keep the default behaviour with possible performance penalties set skipLibCheck to false to hide this warning."
